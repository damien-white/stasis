# Stasis

Prototype implementations of concurrent data structures.

## Purpose

This repository is a tool for brainstorming and is intended to produce useful implementations that
can be used in real projects.

### Building Blocks

Currently, the basic building blocks used are concurrency-based primitives and data structures such
as:

- `Arc`: atomically reference-counted pointers
- `Mutex`: mutual exclusion locks
- `Condvar`: condition variables
